## About this Project
This is the repository for Signify. The support code has a tool that has the ability to translate ASL to text and vice versa. We aim to improve the quality of nonverbal communication worldwide, allowing those that are deaf or hard of hearing to attain greater opportunites and a more comfortable communication experience.
